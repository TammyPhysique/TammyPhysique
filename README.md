* The human body and soul is really fascinating. How it all works together is so interesting. As a personal trainer I know everything about the body and health. And as a sports psychologist I know everything about the mind and brain. All this knowledge I would love to use it and create a dream job in health care that is combined with engineering, data, science, research and technology.* A good developer who can motivate herself excellently and works independently, but also in a team. Takes the initiative to maintain a continuous dialogue with direct colleagues and all other stakeholders. Keeps the overview, plans and communicates.

* Has no problems with deadlines. With the scrum approach I know how to estimate well and I can deliver on time.

* Takes the time to understand the customer and end users. Takes the time to delve into personas, user stories and actively inquires to make sure that I am building something that the customer is really waiting for.

* Delivers quality. Delivering quality means on the one hand building what the customer wants and on the other hand making something that works well.
  Quality also means maintainable software. Writes codes with an eye to the future so that there is room for adjustments and extensions. Clear codes with a good and clear structure.

* Has never stopped learning and is open to all innovations. That means taking courses, reading professional literature, following blogs and vlogs, going to user group meetings & events and talking with colleagues about what is happening in the field.

* Is inventive and creative. Also good at logical reasoning and problem solving. Not only in terms of design, but about coming up with creative solutions. About experimenting, trying to make something new, something your customer didn't even know they needed. Or even: which no one thought was possible.
  Comes up with solutions that are only fast and easy to read, but also work smart and are practical for the user.

* Stress resistant. Think of the dynamics that work entails, the continuous pressure to keep up with the further development of products and technologies, changing customers and working environments, long days when something really needs to be delivered. Make choices all day long. For me, this is precisely the challenge that makes the work fun.

* Very flexible and no 9-to-5 mentality. Well known in multiple areas and with multiple programs.

* Has a critical view on the project and work. Delivering quality is essential.

* Curious, ambitious and is a nice colleague. A critical, curious attitude leads to new, creative solutions. And is a huge perfectionist.
